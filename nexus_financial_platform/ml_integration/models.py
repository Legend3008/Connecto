# ML MODELS IN PRODUCTION:
# - Ensemble models for return prediction (Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Networks)
# - Regime detection using Hidden Markov Models
# - Natural language processing for news sentiment
# - Reinforcement learning for execution algorithms
# - Anomaly detection for risk management
# - Factor timing models using LSTM networks

# MODEL GOVERNANCE:
# - Monthly model performance reviews
# - A/B testing for new model implementations
# - Feature importance tracking and stability
# - Bias detection and fairness metrics
# - Model interpretability requirements
# - Backtesting with walk-forward analysis

# Placeholder for actual implementation
