# risk_management_engine/engine.py

# PRIMARY RISK FUNCTIONS:
# - Real-time portfolio risk calculation (VaR, CVaR, Expected Shortfall)
# - Multi-factor risk model implementation (Barra, Axioma, proprietary)
# - Stress testing across 10,000+ scenarios
# - Correlation matrix monitoring with decay factors
# - Tail risk analysis using extreme value theory
# - Counterparty exposure tracking and netting
# - Liquidity risk assessment across asset classes
# - Regulatory capital requirement calculations

# RISK OUTPUTS:
# - Risk contribution by position, sector, factor
# - Marginal risk contributions for optimization
# - Risk budget allocation and utilization
# - Early warning alerts for limit breaches
# - Scenario-based P&L projections
